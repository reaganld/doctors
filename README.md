# Doctors
For the Veradigm take home assessment.

Displays a list of NC doctors. To finish in a reasonable time, this application uses a list of example doctors sourced from zocdoc.com.

Allows the user to filter doctors by any combination of specialty, location, and minimum rating. Additionally, a user can click a doctor to display their address as well as similar doctors. "Similar" is assumed to mean either having the same specialty or being in the same city. Doctors are always sorted from highest to lowest rating.

Given more time, I would find an API to gather large amounts of healthcare provider data. Additionally, I would set up a proper server connected to a database to store provider information. I would also provide separate pages for displaying more provider information when clicked, as well as a means for contacting each provider.

Estimated time: 2 hours
Actual time (minus breaks): ~3.5 hours
